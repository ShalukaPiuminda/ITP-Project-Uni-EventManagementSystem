Livestock Fisheries and Nutrition at Wayamba University, named Premier Planners, aims to 
streamline and enhance the overall organization of various events and functions with features like 
Event Creation and Management. This system empowers organizers to efficiently plan and 
coordinate gatherings. Ticket Booking functionality facilitates a seamless reservation process for 
attendees, while Video Upload and Management ensure that event recordings or promotional 
content can be easily shared and accessed.. 
 
The inclusion of Event Details and Calendar provides a centralized platform for users to stay 
informed about upcoming activities, helping them plan their schedules accordingly. The Payment 
Handling feature facilitates smooth transactions for ticket purchases or event fees, contributing to 
a more convenient experience for participants. Additionally, Feedback Handling allows attendees 
to share their thoughts and suggestions, aiding organizers in improving future events. 
 
The Admin/User Management aspect ensures that the system is secure and well-controlled, with 
designated administrators overseeing the platform's overall functioning. This comprehensive 
event management system not only enhances the efficiency of event planning and execution but 
also fosters better communication between organizers and participants, ultimately enriching the 
university society's overall experience
